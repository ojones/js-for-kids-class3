This repo was made for classroom purposes. It is perfect for allowing kids to edit and deploy to Github Pages.

# Install

Instead of using the command line terminal, kids were taught how to edit from Github alone.

# Usage

Enter a planet or moon and click "Search" to download pictures from NASA. Then enter a max number to limit search.

# Deploy

To make your own website that talks to NASA: 
1. Click "Fork" button to copy this code to your own repo
2. Click on "Setting" tab in your own repo
3. Scroll down to "Github Pages"
4. Select "master-branch" for Source and click "Save"

Your apps link will display in green just below the "Github Pages" heading when it is live.

# Personal Note

I think APIs are one of the very first things kids should learn in school. Instead, we found many kids did not even know what a url was. This is because modern web browsers hide url addresses. Kids only use the address bar to search Google.

[This](https://ojones.github.io/js-for-kids-class3/) project showed how easy it was to ask NASA for data. On top of that kids could deploy it easily to their own repos.
